## preproc_reconall_parallel.bash -- Perform the FreeSurfer recon-all structural MRI pipeline for a number of subjects in parallel, based on a directory with nifti (.nii) files.
## Written by Tim Sch√§fer, 2018-11-22
##
## This script uses GNU Parallel to fully utilize all cores of your machine.
## You also need FreeSurfer, of course.
#
# It is strongly recommended to run this script from a 'GNU screen' session with the 'screen' command to ensures it continues running on the remote machine when your
# local PC/MAC restarts for system updates or you accidently close the terminal window. E.g., start a session named "reconENIGMA" with 'screen -S reconENIGMA'. Make sure
# FreeSurfer is setup correctly in the session before running.

# Set SUBJECTS_DIR environment variable. This is require for the recon-all FreeSurfer command.
export SUBJECTS_DIR=$(pwd)
APPTAG="[PREPROC_PARALLEL]"

## Default settings. Do NOT adapt these, simply use command line arguments instead! There is no need to edit this script. ##
